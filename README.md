#Debugging

Choosing the right pins to read for the logic analyzer was a difficult task, mostly guess and check because I wasn't getting results that looked right. In the required functionality creating an 8 by 8 block was difficult because I had to find the correct addresses for it. And still where the block is created is off-center. I could fix this by possible changing the X and Y coordinates I entered.
